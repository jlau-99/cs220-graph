/**
 * Class to represent a single node (or vertex) of a graph.
 * 
 * Node can be used for either directed or undirected graphs, as well as
 * for weighted or unweighted graphs. For unweighted graphs, use something like 1 for all 
 * of the weights. For undirected graphs, add a directed edge in both directions.
 * 
 * You want to make as many operations O(1) as possible, which means you will
 * probably use a lot of Maps.
 * 
 * Side note: You can tell that I come from a networking background and not a mathematical
 * background because I almost always use the term "node" instead of "vertex".
